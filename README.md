A python script that describes what it just printed out. So meta.

When I found this file in a folder of old python scripts, I had no idea what it did. Basically, when you put in a number of iterations it prints out a 1, followed by a "description" of what it just printed. For instance, if I tell it to loop for 4 iterations:
1
11
21
1211
Why? It printed out a 1, so the next line states that it printed out one 1. That line was two ones, so the next line says 21. The line after says that it printed out one 2 and one 1. And so on. Me from the past apparently had a lot of time on his hands...
